# ðŸš€ Getting started with Strapi

Strapi comes with a full featured [Command Line Interface](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/cli) (CLI) which lets you scaffold and manage your project in seconds.

## setup

based on the[ setup guide](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/quick-start) here but without the `--quickstart`` flag

- start posgres server with docker-compose `docker-compose -f docker-compose.db.yaml up`
- set the correct env vars in the .env file
- then run `npm run build` and `npm start` (for production) or `npm run dev` for development
- then you can open the strapi UI on http://localhost:1337/ and start creating collection types and entries

## setup with docker
 Run the `docker-compose.yml` file in this folder, this builds a new strapi API container along with the postgres container


 ## Add Collection Types
 add a new folder in the `./src/api` folder (similar to e.g. `/test`), with the following files: a schema.json file, a controller, a route and a service. Then you need to run `npm run strapi ts:generate-types` to generate the necessary types.

 ## Export & Import
Using the command `npm run strapi export -- --no-encrypt --file my-strapi-export` you can create an export from strapi, which includes all types and entities. Optionally you can set an encryption key for more security. 

This exported file can be imported e.g. in a new strapi instance using the command `npm run strapi import -- --file my-strapi-export.tar.gz`.

- start posgres server with docker-compose `docker-compose -f docker-compose.db.yaml up`
- set the correct env vars in the .env file
- then run `npm run build` and `npm start` (for production) or `npm run dev` for development
- then you can open the strapi UI on http://localhost:1337/ and start creating collection types and entries
